- 👋 Hi, My name is tony and blue is my favorite color.
- 📘 I'm an oldman going back to university for computer science. I already have an engineering degree so am just trying to organize all the data, in my head.
- 🤖 Trying to also graduate from tutorial 💀
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to use GitHub, learning how to create stuff, and learn how to share my stuff!
- 🌱 I’m currently in a high-intense confusing, too much to learn, learning phase.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project which provides a learning environment.
- 📫 How to reach me thru GitHub.
